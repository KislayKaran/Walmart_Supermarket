### 50 k Products with 4.6 k stores with Users to Genrate Purchase History .


We will be Generating our Actual Purchase History 

for one year of Purchase History (2021) based on months of the synthetic User Data.

Our Consumer Purchase History will be generated by generating Customer Purchase Transactional Records.

In this process, we identify the store that is closest to the user's address by using their address longitude/latitude

and a store longitude/latitude within a certain radius.

These user profiles are all across the US.

But we will be considering the Purchase history of 5 states only.

['TX','FL','CA','NC','GA']  :   For Texas , Florida , California , North Carolina ,Gorgeia State.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this Phase Our Master & Transactional Data is Ready for the Final purchase History evaluation in the next Phase (Phase 5) .
